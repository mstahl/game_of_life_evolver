# Evolutionary Game of Life Simulator

This little app just runs a Conway's game of life simulation, and uses it to
evolve specific kinds of organisms within the game, like very fast (or very
slow) gliders, spaceships that move in specific ways, or oscillators with
specific properties.

## Contributing to game_of_life
 
  * Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been
    implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
  * Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested
    it and/or contributed it.
  * Fork the project.
  * Start a feature/bugfix branch.
  * Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
  * Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
    future version unintentionally.
  * Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want
    to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but
    please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
